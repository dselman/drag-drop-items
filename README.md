drop-drop-items
===============

I created this little HTML page so that I could help a group of people to rank a list of product features.

The HTML page containing Javascript that allows you to use drag and drop to reorder a static list of items.

Simply edit ~/src/drag-drop-items.html to create a list of items that can be ranked using drag and drop inside a web browser. Firefox, Safari and Chrome have been tested.
